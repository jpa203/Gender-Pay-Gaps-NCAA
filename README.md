# Gender-Pay-Gaps-NCAA

This is my final project for my MS Journalism at Boston University.
The premise of this project is to investigative gendeer pay gaps in administrative/coaching positions in college sports - with a specific lens on sports
women excel at (soccer, lacrosse, athletics, swimming etc.) and that are not in the spotlight.


1) The first step is to define a strong methodology as my foundation for analysis. My criteria is as follows:
    - Public colleges (where NCAA Revenue and Expense Reports) are available.
    - Moreover, public collegs where women historically excel in sports.
 
Upon further research, it was discovered that the NCAA has a power ranking database for women's soccer based on RPI (Ratings Power Index) - which is made up of three components - a team's winning percentange, average opponent's winning percentage and average opponent's opponent's winning percentage. Essentially, it ranks on strength of schedule.

I developed a web scraping tool to extract the first 50 schools on this list to be used in my investigation.
  
  

2) I then decided to create a web scraping program to get all press email addresses from all 50 schools. I noticed that *most* athletic departments have the same HTML code, which makes it easier to iterate through and parse. The code for that can be found here.
