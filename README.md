# Gender-Pay-Gaps-NCAA

This is my final project for my MS Journalism at Boston University.
The premise of this project is to investigative gendeer pay gaps in administrative/coaching positions in college sports - with a specific lens on sports
women excel at (soccer, lacrosse, athletics, swimming etc.) and that are not in the spotlight.

Useful resources:


1) The first step is to define a strong methodology as my foundation for analysis. My criteria is as follows:
    - Public colleges (where NCAA Revenue and Expense Reports) are available.
    - Moreover, public collegs where women historically excel in sports.
    - This data will select the top 50 schools for analysis.

2) I then decided to create a web scraping program to get all email addresses from university athletic department websites. I noticed that *most* athletic departments have the same HTML code, which makes it easier to iterate through and parse. The code for that can be found here. 
    
    
2) I have automated an email bot using Python to send out emails requesting NCAA Revenue and Expense Reports from the aforementioned schools.


3) Next Step.
